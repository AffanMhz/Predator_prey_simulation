# Predator-Prey Simulator

This is a simple web page to help visualize predator-prey mathematical dynamics using a grid-based simulation and Lotka-Volterra equations.  
You can tune parameters, watch populations evolve, and see how statistical and analytical models compare to the simulated data.

**Inspiration**: This project was inspired by ideas in the Veritasium video "The Scientific Challenge of One Predator, One Prey," which discusses how mathematics and random interactions shape ecosystems.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Adjust simulation controls and observe results.
3. Click "Start" to run, "Pause" to stop, and "Reset" to begin anew.
4. Use analytical tools to compare to theory.

## Features

- Interactive grid simulation (grass, prey, predator)
- Time-series and phase-space visualizations
- Lotka-Volterra modeling with auto estimation
- Export population history as CSV

## Files

- `index.html` — main page and structure
- `style.css` — modern styling with gradients and animations
- `sim.js` — all simulation and math logic
