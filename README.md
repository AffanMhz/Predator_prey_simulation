# Predator-Prey Simulator

This is a simple web page to help visualize predator-prey mathematical dynamics using a grid-based simulation and Lotka-Volterra equations.  
You can tune parameters, watch populations evolve, and see how statistical and analytical models compare to the simulated data.

**Inspiration**: This project was inspired by ideas in the Veritasium video "The Scientific Challenge of One Predator, One Prey," which discusses how mathematics and random interactions shape ecosystems.
